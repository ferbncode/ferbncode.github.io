# About me

My name is Lawrence Pan (lpan) and I am a Software Engineering student at the
University of Waterloo.

I am currently interested in distributed systems and large-scale data
processing/storage infrastructure. I have read Martin Kleppmann's [Designing
Data-Intensive Applications](http://dataintensive.net/), Tyler Akidau's
[Streaming Systems](http://streamingsystems.net/), and numerous papers in this
space.

I have also taken [relevant courses in
school](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/ENG-Software-Engineering), such
as Algorithms, Operation System, Computer Networks, etc.
