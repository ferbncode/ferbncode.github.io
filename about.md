I am Suyash Garg, a third year computer science undergrad at National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur (India). I am highly enthusiastic about fields like machine learning, artificial intelligence and algorithm design. The world of computers is vast and each of the corners draw my attention. I am also zealous about team work and creating apps or things that can benefit daily activities.
