# About me

My name is Suyash Garg (ferbncode) and I am exploring the amazing world of Software, currently working as a Software Engineer at Zalando.

I am currently interested in distributed systems and messaging systems. I am currently working on [Nakadi](https://github.com/zalando/nakadi) at Zalando, and currently investing time in learning awesome systems like Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper and many others.

I have pursued my Bachelors in Computer Science from National Institute of Technology, Hamipur. I am amazed by the power of Open Source software and try to regularly make my contributions. :)
