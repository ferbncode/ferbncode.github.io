In this talk, I discuss Nakadi - an HTTP API abstraction over Kafka-like queues developed and used as the central Event Streaming Bus at Zalando and Nakadi SQL - a stream processing platform built over Nakadi event types with SQL-based syntax. 

Nakadi SQL allows to create queries to filter, project, join and transform events published to Nakadi event types. The queries, which can be created with a SQL syntax run as Kafka Stream applications and generate events to another Nakadi event type.
